System_Daemon is a PHP class that allows developers to create their own daemon 
applications on Linux systems. The class is focussed entirely on creating & 
spawning standalone daemons, and for example includes:

   1. Methods to generate OS-specific startup-files (init.d) (currently only 
      Debian/Ubuntu are supported), so that your application gets started on 
      reboot as well.
   2. Methods for logging purposes
   3. Simple syntax
