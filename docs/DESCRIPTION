System_Daemon is a PHP class that allows developers to create their own daemon 
applications on Linux systems. The class is focussed entirely on creating & 
spawning standalone daemons, and for example includes:

   1. Methods to generate OS-specific startup-files (init.d) (currently only 
      Debian/Ubuntu are supported), so that your application gets started on 
      reboot as well.
   2. Methods for logging purposes
   3. Simple syntax
   4. Support for PEAR's Log package
   5. Can run with or without PEAR (PEAR adds more elegance & functionality)
   6. Default signal handlers, but optionally reroute signals to your own 
      handlers. 
   7. Log levels comply with PEAR_LOG_ levels but are called SYSTEM_DAEMON_LOG_ 
      for (in)dependency reasons
   8. Set options like max RAM usage
